# RTLauncher
RTLauncher is a lightweight and minimalist Android retro game launcher, designed primarily for Android handheld consoles and TV boxes.
It provides a clean, full-screen interface to browse your game library by system and launch games using external emulators.

✅ Current Features
Runs on Android devices (handheld consoles, tablets, TV boxes)
ROM scanning using Android SAF (Storage Access Framework)
Automatic system detection based on ROM extensions
System-based navigation (NES, SNES, N64, GBA…)
Persistent game library (scan results are saved and restored on app restart)
Full-screen, console-friendly UI
N64 fully functional via M64Plus FZ
External emulator launching (no built-in emulation)

⚠️ Current Limitations
RetroArch integration is still experimental
Games may open RetroArch without auto-loading the ROM
Further intent/core handling is work in progress
No metadata scraping yet (covers, descriptions, videos)
No per-system emulator configuration (for now)

🛠️ Planned Features / Roadmap
Improved RetroArch integration
Support for more systems:
PSP
PlayStation 2
Nintendo DS
Game Boy / Game Boy Color
Sega systems
Emulator selection per system
Metadata support (box art, game info)
Favorites and recently played games
Better controller and TV-mode support

🎯 Project Goals

RTLauncher aims to stay:
Fast
Simple
Launcher-only (no emulator duplication)
Optimized for handheld and couch gaming

This project is still in active development and serves as a learning and experimentation playground around Android, SAF, and emulator integration.
